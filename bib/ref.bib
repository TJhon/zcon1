abstract = {This study combines panel data techniques with wavelet spectral analysis to investigate the complex and controversial relationship between energy consumption and GDP. The approach in this study makes it possible to differentiate the relationship over time horizons, in addition to taking into account heterogeneity and dependence across cross-sectional units. This leads to more precise conclusions for decision-making, overcoming the limited understanding that previous studies offer when considering aggregated data for a single time horizon. Our analysis is applied to the 50 states of the U.S.A. for the period 1963 to 2017; it is then replicated for a broad set of 25 subgroups of states, based on geography, income, energy intensity, energy price and the predominant sector in the economy. Results from the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test show that in the short-run, there is mixed evidence on the direction of causality between energy consumption and GDP, while in the medium- and long-run there is bidirectional causality for most of the subgroups. Although there is a positive co-movement relationship between the cyclical components of these series, the existence and sign of a relationship in the very long run depends substantially on the characteristics of the states. These findings provide important implications for the analysis, formulation and implementation of economic, energy and environmental policies.},

abstract = {Karnataka is a highly progressive and rapidly growing state in India, with huge potential for industrial growth, however, it grapples with power deficits and other problems in electricity sector, which make it a good case study for Indian electricity sector. Given the importance of electricity in the urbanisation and growth process, the paper analyses the electricity consumption trend in Karnataka, examine its causality with economic growth at aggregate and sectoral levels using Granger causality test, and forecast the future electricity consumption applying Holt-Winters smoothening (no seasonality) technique. The general trend reflects higher consumption by the agricultural consumers, compared to the revenue-generating 'Industries' and 'Commercial' categories, mainly due to the policy of de-metering and providing 'free' power to agricultural consumers since late 1980s. The Granger causality tests reveal that there is no causality relation (neutrality hypothesis) between electricity consumption and economic growth in Karnataka, for total, agricultural and industrial consumption. This basically stems from the inaccurate measurements of agricultural consumption, higher dependence on captive generation, and poor quality grid supply. Finally, electricity consumption is predicted to be around 69,347 GW h by 2019−20. Future policies should focus on universal metering, reducing cross-subsidization, supplying good quality and reliable power to all sectors, and economical planning of resource-mix to achieve adequate, productive and efficient electricity consumption.},

In this paper, we review and classify the most important academic studies that have addressed the environmental and economic aspects of IEEPs using a systematic review. The classification of energy policy instruments has been developed based on an analytical approach. We discuss also the outputs, benefits, and barriers of IEEPs, besides a comprehensive argument about the restrictive policies on the rebound effects made after the implementation of these programs. The results disclose that China, USA, and Sweden are the most addressed countries on IEEPs and their applications. In this regard, incentive energy policies e.g., voluntary agreements and subsidies have been applied more than others in the last decade. Furthermore, most of the reviewed studies emphasize energy price reform as an effective practical policy while a few analytical methods can be seen to help policy-makers determine the optimal levels of decision variables. Finally, according to the state-of-the-art analysis, the authors provide some novel recommendations to improve the performance of IEEPs, using some restrictive policies on the negative impacts of rebound effects.},

This paper examines the causal link between renewable energy use and economic growth by employing a threshold model using a 103-country sample in the 1995 to 2015 period. We find that the relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth depends on the amount of renewable energy used. Our results demonstrate that the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is positive and significant if and only if developing countries or non-OECD countries surpass a certain threshold of renewable energy consumption. However, if developing countries use renewable energy below a given threshold level, the effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth is negative. However, we also find that renewable energy consumption has no significant effect on economic growth in developed countries and a positive and significant effect on economic growth in OECD countries. The findings of this paper suggest that for developing countries to realize positive economic growth from their investment to renewable energy, they need to surpass a certain threshold of renewable energy consumption.},

abstract = {The development of mechanization and technology has triggered the growing energy consumption in the agricultural industry. Energy saving in the agriculture industry becomes equally essential with that in the manufacturing, building, and transportation industries. The implementation of reducing energy consumption should be without costing the agricultural production, which is closely related to the food security of human beings. Strong decoupling between energy consumption and economic growth indicates the former decreases while the latter grows, which should be pursued by nations. Therefore, as the first research objective, this study analyzed the decoupling statuses between energy consumption and economic growth in the agricultural industry of 89 countries whose data exist across the period of 2000 to 2016. As a result, only 18 countries have reached strong decoupling. Secondly, this study decomposed agricultural energy consumption in the 89 countries to the effects of a driving factor (i.e., agricultural economic output) and three inhibiting factors (i.e., agricultural land, labor intensity, and energy intensity in descending order). With the identified decoupling statuses, this study provides a substantial understanding of the relationship between agricultural energy consumption and production from a global perspective. Meanwhile, the decomposed factors and corresponding policy implications provide evidence for decision makers of each nation to tailor energy-saving strategies in its agricultural industry.},

Using the recent novel Maki cointegration test, Ng-Perron, Zivot-Andrews, and Kwiatkowski unit root tests along with FMOLS, DOLS and the CCR estimation methods, we relied on an annual frequency data from 1971-2014. Results from FMOLS, DOLS and the CCR regression confirms the electricity consumption-driven economic growth. This is desirable as Nigeria is heavily dependent on energy (electricity) consumption. A unidirectional causality from urbanization to electricity consumption and economic growth was found but the long-run empirical findings revealed urbanization impedes growth — a situation that has policy implications. The study highlights that though urbanization is a good predictor of Nigeria's economic growth, however, the adjustment of the energy portfolio to meet the growing urban demand will curtail the adverse and far-reaching impact of urbanization on the economy.},

Panel data analysis such as fully modified ordinary least squares, pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effects methods were used with data ranging from 1994 to 2015. Both models across all the three estimation techniques show that renewable energy consumption had a significant negative effect on economic growth in support of the findings by Silva et al. (2012) and Lee and Jung (2018). What is also clear across all the three panel data analysis methods used is that education reduced the size of the negative effect of renewable energy consumption on economic growth in BRICS. In other words, education is a channel through which renewable energy consumption's influence on economic growth is enhanced, in support of views by Dunn and Mutti (2004), Ozcicek and Agpak (2017) and Lawrence et al. (1991). The implication of the study is that BRICS countries are therefore urged to invest more in education as that is more likely to enhance the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth.},

Utilization of energy with the highest efficiency capacity is very important for sustaining the growth of the countries. Effects of energy consumption on economic growth differ from country to country depending on economic structure and economic growth process of country. For this reason, there is no exact opinion related to direction of causality relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. In the literature there are four hypotheses (growth, protective, objectivity, feedback) which explain the relationship of the point in the question. In this context, in order to implement a strategically correct energy policy, one of the growth and energy indicators should be tested correctly. This study examines the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) for the period of 1992-2018. According to the findings of the study, there is a two-way causality between energy consumption and economic growth in CIS countries. This shows that the feedback hypothesis is valid in these countries.},

The cointegration test result confirms the presence of long run cointegration relationship among electricity consumption, international trade openness, and economic growth. The estimated results of the long run point out that electricity consumption and international trade openness showed a significant positive relationship relating to economic growth. The estimated error correction term coefficient is found to be significant at a 1{\%} significance level with an expected sign. The findings of this paper suggest that Sudan's economy takes advantage of promoting electricity production and more open international trade. Therefore, the policies that support and encourage electricity generation for effective uses are highly recommended. The engagement in international trade creates opportunities for Sudan's economy to benefit from the comparative advantage in exporting some goods that have a comparative advantage in Sudan as well as to import modern technologies particularly, the machineries and equipment relating to agriculture and industrial sectors recently to improve economic growth.},

Though several studies have focused on economy–environment–financial development nexus, yet very limited literature has highlighted the impact of ICT on the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and financial development. We address this gap in the existing literature by investigating the nexus between ICT, energy consumption, and economic growth for a panel of 10 emerging and developing Asian countries selected on the bases of the highest current gross domestic product price (in US dollars), for a span of 17 years ranging from 2000 to 2017. Unlike the previous studies, this study employs the advanced econometric techniques that are robust to heterogeneities across nations and have proven to produce more reliable and efficient results. Our findings opine a bidirectional causality between ICT, energy consumption, and economic growth. Additionally, internet and mobile cellular subscriptions have a positive impact on economic growth, while energy consumption report negative impact, and the results for medium and high technological export reveals an insignificant impact on the economic growth of the 10 countries under study. Overall, the results are consistent for all the countries analyzed in this empirical study. The study provides valuable policy lessons to adopt ICT-enabled technologies that will bring innovative changes and further lead to increased economic growth. It is recommended that the government must promote green ICT technology and enhance the technological industry that shall lead to higher productivity and sustainable development.},

abstract = {Fossil energy is the foundation of national economic development due to its ability to affect security and environmental and socioeconomic stability. As the fossil energy supply has become increasingly severe, exploring the decoupling relationship between fossil energy consumption and economic growth in each province is critical, and the results will be beneficial for clarifying the current resource security pattern. This paper uses the environmentally extended multiregional input-output model, combined with China's energy consumption data in 2002, 2007 and 2012, to calculate energy consumption based on various energy sources from the production and consumption sides in China's 30 provinces. Additionally, the Tapio decoupling model is used to measure the decoupling situation between the energy consumption and economic growth of each province from both sides. (1) From 2002-2012, the total energy consumption of the production and consumption sides in China showed an annually increasing tendency, and the structural contradiction of energy security remained acute. (2) The decoupling relationship between total energy and economic growth in developed regions is often overestimated, while most of the central and western regions are relatively backward in this state. (3) In 2007–2012, the decoupling states of coal and oil on both sides are significantly better than those in 2002–2007. With the contribution of coal and oil consumption to economic growth continuing to decline, the decoupling states between natural gas consumption and economic growth in most provinces are strongly negative, and economic growth in these regions increasingly depends on natural gas. Our study can help to strengthen the understanding of the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth both on the production side and the consumption side from the perspective of the decoupling states of different energy sources. This paper recommends that China strengthen its sustainable energy output, effectively transform its energy-consuming structure, and promote economic development policies according to local conditions.},

abstract = {In a context of energy transition, the objectives of both economic growth and sustainability are increasingly influenced by political agendas worldwide. Assuming that growth and sustainability may be divergent, the question of how they are measured arises. Therefore this chapter considers two different approaches: the economic growth approach, using the standard real gross domestic product per capita; and the sustainable development approach, using the index of economic and sustainable welfare. With a time span from 1995 to 2014, for 55 countries around the world, a quantile regression model for panel data was used to analyze energy use, economic growth, and sustainability. The novel aspect of this chapter is not only to analyze and compare economic growth and approaches to sustainable development, but also to carry out the analysis by level of income and development. This option sheds light on some of the inconsistencies documented in the literature. The quantile estimation regression was estimated step by step. The results proved that the effect of energy use is quite different to sustainability and economic growth approaches. Energy use plays a different role in each level of income; positive, neutral, and negative for lower, middle, and upper income level, respectively. While the consequence is negative for lower and middle on sustainability level, it is positive for high sustainable countries. Overall, this chapter provides evidence for the need to devise different policies depending on whether they are focused on economic growth or sustainable development.},

abstract = {In recent decades, various policies have been implemented to reduce energy consumption, as well as a considerable increase in research that analyzes the determinants of energy consumption, both with a standard feature, mitigating environmental degradation. However, few studies investigate the economic and spatial determinants of energy consumption in the European Union (EU). Therefore, to cover the knowledge gap, based on the review of the existing literature, this document is designed to analyze the determinants and energy policy in energy consumption in the EU. For this reason, the objective of this research is to analyze the effect of human capital, the price of oil, and Kyoto Protocol policy on energy consumption. In addition, the effect of contiguity and spatial concentration on energy consumption is studied for 34 European countries, of which 26 belong to the EU, for the period 2000-2016. For this, data collected from theWorld Bank (2017) and theWorld Energy Statistical Review (2017) were used. The work methodology is based on the application of econometric techniques for panel data, and spatial econometrics, based on the application of a Spatial Durbin Model (SDM), through which the existence of "spillovers" was determined in the implementation of the energy policy. The results of the estimates show a negative effect of the price of oil and human capital concerning energy consumption, and the variable "Policy" reflects a reduction in the energy consumption of the EU countries in the period analyzed. Additionally, the space panel confirms that the behavior of a country's energy consumption depends on its past values and the level of consumption presented by its neighbors, corroborating the importance of territorial contiguity in the success of environmental policy in the case of the European Union.},

We use time series data from 1971 to 2014 and employ the Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. The NARDL testing results affirms asymmetric co-integration among the variables. Asymmetric causality is noted between positive shocks in energy consumption and economic growth running from energy consumption to economic growth. A feedback effect is found between agriculture and economic growth for positive shocks. A unidirectional nexus is noted between capital and economic growth for both positive and negative shocks. Similarly, the results of a Granger causality test indicate symmetric causality between energy consumption, agriculture, capital and economic growth. This research suggests that policymakers should revisit their policies regarding agriculture and energy sectors by attracting foreigner investors to build new hydropower dams to both affirm the availability of energy to the industrial sector and control the scarcity of water.},

The result shows the significant spatial autocorrelation of energy consumption and air pollution in the "2+26" cities. The increase in economic output of neighbouring cities will bring about economic radiation and promote the economic output of the city, which provides strong evidence for the necessity of joint prevention and control policy. Further considering effects of the inputs of neighbouring cities, the paper finds that the driving force of economic increase mainly came from the capital and energy input of the city itself, as well as the air pollution dividends of neighbouring cities. Therefore, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its surrounding areas should make the best of the resource advantages of neighbouring cities to achieve complementarity and coordinated development. Governments should construct comprehensive cross-city air pollution prevention mechanism, such as regional air pollution compensation mechanism and fund for air pollution joint control.},

To this end, our study relies on annual data from 1971 to 2014 for the econometric analysis while accounting for structural break(s). According to the Maki cointegration test, a cointegration equilibrium relationship exists among electricity consumption, economic growth, and carbon dioxide emissions. The empirical findings from Toda-Yamamoto causality test provided the following insights: (i) unidirectional causality was found running from economic growth to electricity consumption. Thus, this study validates the conservative hypothesis, meaning that in Pakistan, conservative energy strategies cannot harm economic progress. (ii) Causality was also found running from electricity consumption to carbon dioxide emissions. This implies that industrial activities trigger an increase in carbon emissions flaring which in return translates into environmental degradation. This outcome has inherent policy implications which are further discussed in the conclusion section.},

Based on the panel data in 2000 to 2016 of China, this paper tries to explain theinconsistency between electricity consumption and economic growth. For example, in 2015, GDP growth rate was close to 6.9{\%} but with only 2.9{\%} growth in electricity consumption. However, in 2018, a 6.6{\%} growth in GDP required an 8.5{\%} electricity growth. The results explain the reasons for inconsistency and identify the key factors. We find that the increase in inventory, fixed capital and industrial electricity consumption will narrow the gap when economy grows faster than electricity consumption, and widen the gap on the contrary. Heterogeneity exists among regions, the model and variables seem most convincing in explaining the situation in the western region, which is most similar to the full sample of China. Feedback effect is also observed between electricity consumption and economic growth in most parts of China by Granger test. The findings provides suggestions for the policy makers in making power planning, in an effort to avoid large power shortage or surplus.},

abstract = {Energy is the material basis for the development of national economy. However, energy shortages become increasingly serious as a result of the growing population and the modernization of the global economy. Therefore, investigating drivers of energy consumption is crucial to coordinate the relationship between energy and national economic growth. This study aimed to uncover the effects of energy prices (EP), urbanization (URN) and GDP on per capita energy consumption (EC) with considering the income gaps between countries. The paper adopted the Granger causality test approach and the impulse response function analysis by using long-term time series data on EC, EP, URN and GDP during 1980–2015 in 186 countries divided into three groups (high-income, upper- and lower-middle income groups). The results indicated a long-term co-integration relationship among these variables. Granger causality test showed a bidirectional causality between URN and EC in high and lower-middle income countries but no causality in the upper-middle income group. In all groups, there is a bidirectional causal link between GDP and EC. The results of IRF showed that as urbanization level improves, its role in promoting EC become less significant. Moreover, EP affected EC negatively both in high and lower-middle income countries, but it has a positive impact on EC in upper-middle income countries. The study supports the finding that urbanization is an important factor affecting energy consumption per capita, although its contributions vary across income groups, which offers a new pathway to control the excessive growth of energy consumption.},

In this chapter, two alternatives to measure world globalization have been tested. By using the same autoregressive distributed lag approach, the results reveal that China has impacts on the energy-growth nexus worldwide, except in the case of America. Additionally, globalization has been revealed to have long-run impacts on the energy-growth nexus. In consequence it seems that countries should not be indifferent to China's energy policies. In addition, globalization related policies should not be avoided due to the lack of short-run results.},

The A.R.D.L. bounds testing approach to co-integration is applied to investigate the existence of the long-run relationship. The causality was investigated among the variables using Granger causality under the V.E.C.M. framework. The A.R.D.L. bounds testing approach to co-integration confirms a long-run relationship between electricity consumption and its regressors. The empirical estimation indicates the existence of a positive and statistically significant impact of economic growth, trade and urbanisation on electricity consumption for Iceland, not only in the long-run, but also in the short-run. Furthermore, electricity consumption converges to its long-run position by 45.63{\%} speed of adjustment using the channels of urbanisation, trade and economic growth. The results of Granger causality imply the presence of a feedback causal relationship between urbanisation and electricity consumption in the long-run, thus validating the feedback hypothesis. However, economic growth is causing trade, thus validating the growth-led trade hypothesis in the short-run. Additionally, no causal relationship was found between electricity usage and economic growth, which confirms the neutrality hypothesis. Implementing the energy conservation policy will have no damaging effect on economic growth for Iceland.},

abstract = {This study examined the four-way linkages between electricity consumption, CO2 emissions, R{\&}D stocks and economic growth for the MCs over the 1990–2016 periods, by implementing several estimators: SUR, 3SLS and GMM. The specification of these econometric techniques is that the four sets of equations (electricity, CO2, R{\&}D and growth models) are estimated jointly through the system of equations. These techniques make it possible to estimate all the parameters of the models at the same time and solve the problem of endogeneity. Under conditional homoskedasticity, GMM reduces to 3SLS if the set of instrumental variables is common to all equations. If we further assume that all the regressors are predetermined, then 3SLS reduces to SUR. Empirical results confirm the existence of strong feedback effects between electricity, CO2 emissions, R{\&}D stocks and economic growth (especially in SUR estimator). However, the results support the occurrence of unidirectional causality between electricity and R{\&}D stocks (in 3SLS) while the other relationships exist. On the one hand, here is unidirectional causality among R{\&}D stocks and economic growth as well as unidirectional causality between R{\&}D stocks and CO2 emissions, on the other hand (GMM estimator). The study consolidates the policy insights to control the environment from degradation by using energy-efficient technologies. It is important for policymakers in formulating a conclusive, economic, energy and environmental policies to meet the bourgeoning energy demand in MCs. They should concentrate on allocating funds to adopt environmentally friendly technologies and encourage using more energy-efficient technologies for production purposes and thus preserving the environment from degradation.},

abstract = {This study employs the Time-Varying Parameters Vector Autoregressive (TVP-VAR) model with stochastic volatility to examine inter-temporal dynamics between Saudi Arabian real GDP (oil, non-oil), electricity consumption and CO2 emissions levels for 1971–2010. The results show that the TVP-VAR model is of use for examining the dynamics of the relationship between electricity consumption, real GDP and CO2 emissions. Moreover, an analysis of time-varying impulse responses of real GDP (oil, non-oil), electricity consumption and CO2 emissions to structural shocks suggests that responses depend on the magnitude of structural volatilities of real GDP (oil, non-oil), electricity consumption and CO2 emissions shocks. Indeed, we find that the observed high volatility of electricity consumption in the1970's and 1980's is likely to have persistent negative effects on oil GDP levels and CO2 emissions and positive effects on real non-oil GDP levels. The observed high and low volatility of oil GDP levels positively affects electricity consumption and CO2 emissions. However, highly volatile non oil-GDP levels are likely to affect electricity consumption and CO2 emissions positively. These findings imply that energy policies must consider high-and low-volatility regimes of real GDP, electricity and CO2 emissions shocks and time-varying patterns of the relationships between real GDP, electricity consumption and CO2 emissions.},

The Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test is used to test for the presence of cointegration, whereas the Toda and Yamamoto augmented Granger causality test is used for direction of causality. The results of ARDL-bounds test validate the existence of cointegration among the included variables. Further, the Toda and Yamamoto Granger causality test affirms that there is no causality between electricity consumption and economic growth. This signifies that neutrality hypothesis holds for South Africa during the period under the study. Additionally, there is a unidirectional causality running from CO2 emissions to electricity consumption as well as a unidirectional causality running from financial development to CO2 emissions. The empirical finding suggests that policy-makers should establish concrete plans to increase investment in the electricity sector to ensure reliability of supply. Moreover, policy-makers need to address the pressing environmental concern by tapping into the sizeable renewable energy potential of the country. Consequently, it will assist in promoting sustainable economic growth and development.},

Within a framework which takes into consideration dynamics, heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence in the panel, we show that the results obtained from using the PMGE, demeaned PMG, AMG, MGE and DFE models indicate a long-run equilibrium relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth. In order to determine the appropriate model and decide the preferred estimator, the Hausman test was performed. The PMGE model emerged as the most efficient of the three estimators. Also, the results obtained revealed a bi-directional causality between economic growth and electricity consumption in these countries, which supports the feedback hypothesis. As a result, this implies that if these countries adopt or implement any energy or electricity conservation policies, this may have a negative impact on its economic growth.},

abstract = {Developing economies like Nigeria are competing strategically to ensure a rise in sustainable economic growth, and reduction in CO2 emission. The question is, could this be possible amidst the series of energy crises facing the country? It is against this development that this paper investigates empirically if the nexus between economic growth, energy consumption, financial development, trade openness and CO2 emissions in Nigeria could provide a clue. The study used time series data from 1971 to 2011. To ensure a robust result, the study applied the ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration, the Zivot-Andrew structural break test, and the Bayer-Hanck combine cointegration analysis. The causality analysis, was checked using the VECM model and this was validated using the innovative accounting and the impulse response test. The findings of the study revealed that financial development stimulates energy demand, but lowers CO2 emissions. Economic growth lowers energy demand but increases CO2 emissions. In addition to that, the study discovered how Trade openness increases energy consumption but improves environmental quality by lowering CO2 emissions. Energy consumption was on the other hand, found to have significant increase on CO2 emissions. The Granger causality analysis revealed a bidirectional causal relationship between financial development and energy consumption, and the same inference was found in financial development and CO2 emissions. In this study, trade-led energy hypothesis and the existence of a feedback effect between economic growth and CO2 emissions were discovered. The study recommends massive investment in Nigeria's financial sector with the motivation for these sectors to invest in efficient, and sustainable renewable energy system. How it should be done and why it should be done are carefully outlined in this study.},

To the best of the authors' knowledge, most of the studies in this field have applied the error correction models, auto regressive distributed lag and panel data based on fixed‐effect model in which coefficients obtained by these models cannot be deemed as a general finding applicable for other countries. The superiority of our article is in applying full modified ordinary least square estimation method for heterogeneous panels; our study also has stable and consistent coefficients and is also a dynamic model. Moreover, with regard to previous studies, our paper includes more countries which increase the reliability of the results. The results indicate that a long‐run relationship exists between real gross domestic product (GDP), electricity consumption and trade activities that involve export and import (control variable). The short‐run results also indicate the importance of electricity consumption to economic growth and vice versa, supporting the feedback hypothesis which asserts that energy policies oriented towards improvements in electricity consumption efficiency would not adversely affect real GDP. It also appears that policies for energy efficiency have no statistically significant impact on economic growth in long run.},

A number of econometric techniques: dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS), fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and the dynamic fixed effect model (DFE) are applied in order to estimate the long-run relationship between the variables. The long-run relationship is found to be robust across these different econometric specifications. No significant short-run significant relationship was observed. Electricity consumption and economic growth have a positive long run relationship with carbon dioxide (CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) emissions whilst a negative and significant relationship was found between CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions and financial development. The findings imply that electricity consumption and economic growth stimulate CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions in GCC countries while financial development reduces it. Granger causality results reveal that there is a bidirectional causal link between economic growth and CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions and a unidirectional causal link running from electricity consumption to CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions.

Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration, the Johansen cointegration test and the Gregory-Hansen cointegration test with structural break, we show that GR, RELC, NRELC, K and L are cointegrated. Although NRELC has a long run positive effect on GR, the long run estimate of RELC is negative but insignificant at 5{\%} level of significance. The Granger causality test based on the vector error correction model reveals the evidence of neutrality hypothesis between RELC and GR, and between NRELC and GR in Turkey in the short run. In addition, the Granger causality runs from RELC, NRELC, K and L to GR as well as from GR, RELC, K and L to NRELC in the long run, which supports the existence of growth hypothesis between RELC and GR, and feedback hypothesis between NRELC and GR in the long run. It is advised that policy makers in the Turkish government should continue to reduce the share of electricity consumption from renewable sources and encourage the usage of electricity from non-renewable sources to have sustainable long run growth rates.

To accomplish this purpose, we utilize three analytical tools in time series econometrics: The bounds testing cointegration approach, the linear Granger causality test and the nonlinear Granger causality test. We depart from the existing literature on the energy consumption and economic growth nexus in Turkey by testing nonlinearity in the series and carrying out the nonlinear Granger causality test. The cointegration analysis shows that the electricity consumption and economic growth are cointegrated in the long-run. The linear Granger causality test based on the error correction model shows the bi-directional Granger causality in both the short- and the long-run between the electricity consumption and economic growth in Turkey. After filtering out the linear properties of the series with cointegration analysis, we carry out the Brock, Dechert, and Scheinkman nonlinearity test and find evidence of nonlinearity in the series. Therefore, the inferences from the nonlinear Granger causality test are more appropriate than the linear Granger causality analysis for Turkey. The nonlinear causality analysis supports the neutrality hypothesis, implying that electricity conservation policy will not damage the growth in the Turkish economy.

From the Pedroni cointegration test results it was found that renewable electricity consumption, non-renewable electricity consumption, labor, gross fixed capital formation, and total trade are cointegrated. Moreover, the panel Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) test results revealed that all above the mentioned variables have a long run positive effect on GDP growth in the investigated countries.

The results of the study indicated that renewable electricity consumption is more significant than non-renewable electricity consumption in promoting economic growth in the investigated countries in the long run and the short run. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that the investigated countries should increase their investment on renewable energy projects to increase the role of electricity consumption from renewable sources. In addition, it is essential that these countries should reduce their non-renewable electricity consumption by increasing their energy efficiency and implementing energy saving projects. By applying these recommendations, these countries would be able to mitigate global warming and reduce their dependency on fossil fuel to increase their energy security. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

We modified the model such that consumption goods sector uses energy as an input along with capital. The model allows us to show that the growth rate of energy price has a negative effect on the growth rates of energy use and real GDP, consistent with the finding of van Zon and Yetkiner (2003), who studied a similar model by placing energy as an input in the intermediate goods sector. Following this, derived theoretical relationships between energy prices and economic growth and energy consumption were tested empirically using error-correction based panel cointegration tests and panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. We applied this methodology on annual data of composite energy prices, GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita for fifteen countries for the period between 1978 and 2011. We found significant cointegration between energy prices and real GDP per capita as well as between energy prices and energy consumption per capita. Moreover, long-run elasticity estimates reveal a negative and significant impact of composite energy prices on both GDP per capita and energy consumption per capita.},

When investigating the period 1970-2010 only, the estimate of the long-run income elasticity of electricity consumption loses statistical significance and that for heating oil becomes negative. Those results imply a possible decoupling between GDP growth and energy consumption, so that energy conservation policies are not necessarily expected to have a negative impact on Swiss economic growth. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The primary objective is to investigate and analyze the causal relationship between electricity consumption (EC), Brent oil price (BOP) and economic growth (GDP) for Algeria over the period of 1971-2010. To examine short-run, long-run and joint causality relationships we used a multivariate cointegration approach based on the recent advances in time series econometrics (e.g., Zivot-Andrews test; Gregory-Hansen cointegration test; Vector Error Correction Models (VECM)). The empirical results show that there is evidence of short-run and a strong long-run bi-directional causal relationship between EC and real GDP in Algeria. Findings indicate also the absence of causal relationship between BOP and EC. Our empirical findings support the idea that there a link between electricity consumption and economic growth and disproves the neo-classical assumption referred to as the "neutrality hypothesis". {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {As a representative of modern energy, the level of electricity consumption can be regarded as an appraisal criterion of a country's development level. This study analyses the causality between electricity consumption and human development and assesses the changing trend of electricity consumption. The models in this study are established using panel data from 1990-2009 for 50 countries divided into four groups according to income. For human development indicators, per-capita GDP, consumption expenditure, urbanisation rate, life expectancy at birth and the adult literacy rate were selected. The results show that long-run bidirectional causality exists between electricity consumption and five indicators. Additionally, the higher the income of a country, the greater is its electricity consumption and the higher is its level of human development. Further, the variables of four income-groupings vary considerably. Specifically, as income increases, the contribution of electricity consumption to GDP and consumption expenditure increases, but the urbanisation rate, life expectancy at birth and adult literacy rate present a weakening trend. This mainly because that the latter indicators in high-income countries are increasing to converge. To improve human development, electricity should be incorporated into the basic public services construction to enhance the availability of electricity for low-income residents. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Our research was conducted for total electricity consumption as well as for the industrial consumption of electricity. In order to reflect the causality between GDP and electricity consumption properly we performed our investigations in a three-dimensional framework with employment chosen as an additional variable. We used reliable quarterly data from the period Q1 2000-Q4 2009. In order to check the stability of the causalities the investigations were performed on two samples: a full sample and a pre-crisis (i.e. Q1 2000-Q3 2008) subsample. We applied both traditional methods and some recently developed econometric tools. We found feedback between total electricity consumption and GDP as well as between total electricity consumption and employment. We also found unidirectional causality running from industrial electricity consumption to employment and no direct causal links between industrial electricity consumption and GDP. In addition, all these findings were, in general, not seriously affected by the financial and economic crises of 2008. A significant exception is the causal effect of industrial electricity consumption on employment, which was more pronounced after the crisis of 2008. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The unit root tests results indicate that some of the variables for Algeria, Jordan, Tunisia and United Arab Emirates do not satisfy the underlying assumptions of the ARDL bounds testing approach of cointegration methodology before proceeding to the estimation stage. Thus, we drop these countries from the ARDL bounds testing approach of cointegration and causality analysis. The cointegration test results show that there is no cointegration between the electricity consumption and the economic growth in three of the seven countries (Iran, Morocco and Syria). Thus, causal relationship cannot be estimated for these countries. However, the cointegration and causal relationship is found in four countries (Egypt, Israel, Oman and Saudi Arabia). The overall results indicate that there is no relationship between the electricity consumption and the economic growth in most of the MENA countries. Further evidence indicates that policies for energy conservation can have a little or no impact on economic growth in most of the MENA countries. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We firstly obtain solid and convincing evidence of a fairly strong long-run equilibrium relationship among them. Secondly, it is found that the capital stock is much more productive than energy consumption. Third, it is observed that neglecting the impact of the capital stock on income tends to overestimate the effect of energy consumption. Finally, the panel causality test shows bi-directional causal linkages exist among energy consumption, the capital stock and economic growth.

It employs the production side model (aggregate production function). The empirical results fully support a positive long-run cointegrated relationship between real GDP and energy consumption when the heterogeneous country effect is taken into account. It is found that although economic growth and energy consumption lack short-run causality, there is long-run unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to economic growth. This means that reducing energy consumption does not adversely affect GDP in the short-run but would in the long-run; thus, these countries should adopt a more vigorous energy policy. Furthermore, we broaden the investigation by dividing the sample countries into two cross-regional groups, namely the APEC and ASEAN groups, and even more important results and implications emerge. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present the likelihood methods for the analysis of cointegration in VAR models with Gaussian errors, seasonal dummies, and constant terms. We discuss likelihood ratio tests of cointegration rank and find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. We characterize the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations and formulate tests of structural hypotheses about these relations. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the $\chi$ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} distribution.

abstract = {Abstract Let n observations Y 1, Y 2, {\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}, Y n be generated by the model Y t = pY t−1 + e t , where Y 0 is a fixed constant and {\{}e t {\}} t-1 n is a sequence of independent normal random variables with mean 0 and variance $\sigma$2. Properties of the regression estimator of p are obtained under the assumption that p = ±1. Representations for the limit distributions of the estimator of p and of the regression t test are derived. The estimator of p and the regression t test furnish methods of testing the hypothesis that p = 1.},
